Plugins still work; this is just so they all use the same format. I'm still working on it. This file is for my use.
*Have plugins use $MNT and $WORK instead of current dir and multicd-working, respectively
*Have plugins use new "mcdmount" and "mcdumount" functions included in multicd.sh
*Use echo instead of cat for writing to isolinux.cfg
*Optional: use "initrd" isolinux command instead of putting initrd in append (new usage)
*Add "links" option to each plugin
