.SH NAME
MultiCD \- Build a custom CD/DVD/USB image from multiple live CDs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B multicd
[OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
MultiCD is a shell script that looks for bootable ISO9660 images (live CDs) that it can recognize in the current directory and builds a new, combination ISO image that can be burned to a CD or DVD (with wodim) or copied to a flash drive (with dd - this will delete all data on the drive.) It also accepts any floppy disk image (.img extension).
.TP
\fBclean\fR
Removes all symbolic links to files in the current directory, as well as all files ending in ".defaultname" or ".version". From version 6.7 on, this is also run after MultiCD has successfully made the ISO. You still might want to run it manually if a build fails, and you later change what ISOs you are using.
.TP
\fBgui\fR
Launches zenity to ask the user for a working directory, then launches an X terminal (x-terminal-emulator on Debian/Ubuntu, xterm otherwise) to actually run MultiCD in. This is used by the .desktop launcher in the menu. If zenity is not installed, MultiCD will open a terminal window to give an error message.
.TP
\fB-c\fR
Creates an md5sum.txt on the root of the ISO with the checksums of all other files. Can be checked with the -c option of md5sum.

.SH BUGS
Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout, stderr, and
data for forwarded X11 and TCP connections).
The compression algorithm is the same used by
.Xr gzip 1 ,
and the
.Dq level
can be controlled by the
.Cm CompressionLevel
option for protocol version 1.
