MultiCD
========

A fork of MultiCD[] with a few fixes and a new plugin. It contains,

* A plugin to copy arbitrary files under a "backup" folder to the final ISO. This is useful if you use a full system backup[] to generate a tarball. You can place your tarball and any other useful files/scripts etc under a "backup" folder in MultiCD and it'll copy the backup folder to the generated ISO file. I also find the ISO file handy when you want to create a new VM image and you can't add guest additions yet to access host folders.
* A fix for making MultiCD work with current Syslinux's broken up C32 executables
* A fix for rescatux plugin to make it work. Not sure if anyone uses it :)

Enjoy!
